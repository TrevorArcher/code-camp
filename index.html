            <h3>Company</h3>
            <p>Like everyone else, we like to get sh*t done and focus on the daily matters that matter to us most. We are building a transportation mobile payment app for your daily commute. Think FasTrak 2.0, but on your phone.
            </p>
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Building an autonomous mobile payments system that brings convenience to your daily commute.</p>
            <h3>The Team</h3>
            <ul class="team">
                <li><strong>Vicky Nguyen</strong><br>
                    <br> Tech marketer and entrepreneur on the run. In the development of this mobile payments transportation system, I have my love for salsa dancing to thank. My very own commutes of sitting in traffic and pondering had brought
                    this idea to life.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Trevor Archer</strong><br>
                    <br> Traffic is one of those modern inconveniences that everyone seems to accept as the normal way of life. I want to give people the freedom to spend their time as they choose, rather than being stuck in traffic for half of their waking
                    hours. A typical Silicon Valley resident, I spend my time coding, gaming, and mainlining espresso.

                    <strong>Alfonso Gutierrez</strong><br>
                    <br> Hello, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, primarily in the Peninsula. I, recently, lived in Los Angeles for approximately 3 years to experience life and to get out of my comfort zone. I've moved back earlier this year and ready
                    to pursue my interest in Web and Application Development, so I can improve the traffic congestion that I familiarized in LA, and apply it to the local citizens of the Bay Area.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Jason Ma</strong><br>
                    <br> I joined this development team because I wanted to work with the related technology. Having an app that enables clients to pay for all forms of transportation costs with one simple touch makes the clients' lives easier. I'm a former
                    research scientist who has turned to software development because of its applicability to everyday life.

                <li><strong>Adam Makubuya</strong><br>
                    <br> I am a certified Entrepreneur, well-versed in business administration, and currently learning how to code. I love the outdoors and one thing I can say is love getting where I need to go efficiently. What captured my interest in building
                    this product its innovation and the time it saves me while traveling.
